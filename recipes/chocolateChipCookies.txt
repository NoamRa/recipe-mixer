Chocolate Chip Cookies

ingredients
2.25 cups all-purpose flour
0.5 teaspoon baking soda
2 sticks unsalted butter
0.5 cup granulated sugar
1 cup light-brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups semisweet milk chocolate chips

instructions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside. 
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. 
Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute. 
Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. 
Stir in the chocolate chips.
Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.
Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. 
Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. 
Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.
