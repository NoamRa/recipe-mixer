Classic Lemon Meringue

ingredients
2 sticks unsalted butter
1.75 cups all-purpose flour
0.25 cup confectioners sugar
7 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest
0.25 teaspoon coarse salt
6 large eggs
4 large egg whites
2.25 cups granulated sugar
0.75 cup fresh lemon juice

instructions
Preheat oven to 350. 
Make crust: Put butter, flour, confectioners sugar, 2 teaspoons lemon zest, and the salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. 
Mix on medium speed until well blended.
Transfer mixture to a 9-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet. 
Press batter evenly into baking sheet. 
Chill in freezer 10 minutes. 
Bake until golden, 20 to 22 minutes. 
Let cool completely on a wire rack.
Make filling: Whisk together whole eggs, 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, the lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons lemon zest. 
Pour over crust. Bake until filling is set, 18 to 20 minutes. 
Let cool completely on a wire rack. 
Keep oven at 350.
Make meringue topping: Put egg whites and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in the clean bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. 
Beat on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form.
Using an offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread meringue over filling, swirling to create soft peaks. 
Bake until meringue begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. 
Let cool completely. 
Cut into bars. 
Bars can be refrigerated in an airtight container, up to 1 day.
