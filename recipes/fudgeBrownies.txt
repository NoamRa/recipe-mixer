Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. 
Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition; add vanilla. 
Reduce speed to low; add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with the milk mixture and beginning and ending with the flour; beat until just combined.
Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top with an offset spatula. 
Bake until a cake tester comes out clean, about 55 minutes. 
Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool completely.
